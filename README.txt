This is a basic 3D Maze game. The maze is randomly generated. You look around for coins, when you pick up a coin, the maze changes slighly and eventually after gathering some, a multi colored cube will have to be picked up to progress to the next level
The required dependancies for the game are GLFW, glad, glm.

The source of the game is this link:

I have added better comments, removed jumping, added screenshots, added some other shaders (sadly not in use, but I left them nontherless).
